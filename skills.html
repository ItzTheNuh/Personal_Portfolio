      <h2><u>What is HTML?</u></h2>
      <hr>
      <p><b>HTML</b> is a programming language which defines the structure of websites. HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>.It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
      <n>
      <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
